      <h1>Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
      <p>The kid who started with nothing but a dream—and became the greatest Hokage the Leaf Village ever knew.</p>

      <h2>From Outcast to Hokage</h2>
      <p>Naruto grew up alone, shunned by his village for the beast sealed inside him. But he never gave up. Through sheer will, he proved himself to the world, forging unbreakable bonds and protecting those dear to him.</p>

      <h2>Power and Purpose</h2>
      <p>With signature techniques like the Rasengan and Shadow Clone Jutsu—and later, the power of Sage Mode and Kurama—Naruto fought to defend peace and change the shinobi world. His resolve became unshakable, his compassion unbreakable.</p>

      <h2>A Quote to Remember</h2>
      <p><em>"I’m not gonna run away, I never go back on my word! That’s my nindō — my ninja way!"</em></p>
